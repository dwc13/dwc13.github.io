## Hello!

I'm studying various subfields of autonomous vehicles, such as object detection, tracking, SLAM, locationization, mapping, alignment, cooperative perception, and end-to-end vehicle systems.
In the last three years, I've studied numerous articles about single-agent object detection systems that have modest improvements but no applications for improving real-world autonomous vehicles.
My goal is to investigate the benefits of multi-agent cooperation to improve vehicle perception and mapping in the automotive industry.

## Why PhD?

Growing up, my father, who owned a small mechanic shop, taught me fundamental technical skills and instilled in me a strong work ethic.
However, my lack of understanding regarding the programming of computers sparked my curiosity in the fields of Computer Science and Engineering. 
As a result, I attended [Sul Ross State University](https://www.sulross.edu/) to earn my B.S. in Computer Science.

[Dr. Angela Brown](https://srinfo.sulross.edu/fs/8655), my undergraduate mentor, encourages me to go beyond and challenge myself.
Her faith inspires me, and she keeps telling me, "You can do great things."
In the summer of 2016, I was introduced to Sul Ross State University's McNair Scholars Program.
Attending conferences to present my projects and seeing various presentations or keynotes opened my eyes to expanding my academic knowledge base.

During the career fair, I would spend the majority of my time speaking with university ambassadors.
[Mrs. Kathryn Beasley](https://engineering.unt.edu/people/kathryn-beasley) went out of her way to persuade me to visit the University of North Texas.
During several visits, I had the opportunity to speak with [Dr. Qing Yang](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~qingyang/), who also encouraged me to apply for a Ph.D. and work for him.
Dr. Yang's vehicle research piqued my interest at first, but it eventually expanded to include the entire field of Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles.
