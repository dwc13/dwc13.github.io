## Hello!

I am studying different subfields in Autonomous Vehicle, e.g. Object Detection, Tracking, SLAM, Locationization, Mapping, Alignment, Cooperative Perception, or End-to-End Vehicle System.
In the last 3 years, I have read many single agent object detection systems with simple improvements with no applications to improve real-world autonomous vehicle systems. 
My goal is to seek the benefits of Cooperatation between multiple agents to improve vehicle's Perception and Mapping within the automotive domain.

## Why PhD?

Growing up my father, owning a small mechanic shop, taught me many technical skills with a heavy work ethic.
However, with no knowledge in how computers are programmed I became curious in Computer Science and Engineering.
Thus, went to [Sul Ross State University](https://www.sulross.edu/) to obtain my B.S. in Computer Science.

My Interest in graduate studies start from being part of the McNair Scholars Program at Sul Ross State University in the Summer of 2016.
[Dr. Angela Brown](https://srinfo.sulross.edu/fs/8655), my undergraduate mentor, encourage me to strive and challenge myself. 
Her faith is my motivation, and has repeatly said, "You can do great things."

During my undergraduate studies, I would attend multiple conference to present small research work that I had conducted.
While attending the different presentation or keynotes openned my eyes in expanding my knowledge base in academia.

At the career fair, I would spend majority of my time conversating with multiple university ambassortors.
[Mrs. Kathryn Beasley](https://engineering.unt.edu/people/kathryn-beasley) went the extra mile to pull me to visit University of North Texas.
From multiple visits, I got the chance to talk with [Dr. Qing Yang](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~qingyang/), who also encourage me to apply for the Ph.D. degree and work under him.
Dr. Yang's research with vehicles was my initial interest, however that interest grew as large as the research field of Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles.
